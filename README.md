# README

This README file provides a brief overview of the Python script and its functionalities.

## Description

This Python script analyzes electric vehicle (EV) data using the Plotly and Pandas libraries. It reads the data from a CSV file named 'dataset.csv' and performs several data visualizations.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- plotly

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas plotly
```



## Data Visualization

The script performs the following data visualizations:

### 1. Distribution of Model Year

A histogram showing the distribution of EVs based on their Model Year.

### 2. Electric Range vs. Base MSRP

A scatter plot comparing the Electric Range and Base MSRP of EVs.

### 3. Correlation Matrix Heatmap

A heatmap representing the correlation between different numerical features in the dataset.

### 4. Number of EV Vehicles by Zip Code

A choropleth-like map displaying the number of EV vehicles in different Zip Code areas in Washington state.

### 5. Year-wise Sales of EV Makes from the Last Decade

A racing bar plot showing the year-wise sales of different EV makes over the last decade.
